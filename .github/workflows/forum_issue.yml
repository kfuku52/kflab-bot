            :wave: This is a lab forum for the week of ${{ env.YYYYMMDD }} for reporting and discussing miscellaneous topics. People who have already been assigned to other ${{ env.OPEN_ISSUE_LINK }} are automatically tagged in this forum. Feature requests for this bot should be submitted [here](https://github.com/kfuku52/kflab-bot/issues). Previous weekly forum is \#{{ previousIssueNumber }}.
            
            As assignees, you are expected to post recent updates in the following issues (inactive period in parentheses). Please check the list, and whenever possible, close the issues with a conclusive post. If you feel you are no longer the most qualified personnel for the task, please consult with others about taking over. So far, we have successfully closed ${{ env.CLOSE_ISSUE_LINK }} :tada: Thank you for your contributions to let our lab keep running :thumbsup:

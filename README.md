## Overview
In our laboratory, we manage tasks related to our research projects and lab operations on a private repository on GitHub. This repository (`kflab-bot`) is used for the development of the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)' bots that are used for its operation (stored [here](https://github.com/kfuku52/kflab-bot/tree/main/.github)). To mimic actual usage conditions, we may create random pages on [Issues](https://github.com/kfuku52/kflab-bot/issues) and [Wiki](https://github.com/kfuku52/kflab-bot/wiki) in this repository. However, please feel free to submit bug reports and feature requests as usual.
